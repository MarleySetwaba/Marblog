Simple Laravel RESTful API For Blog Posts
I will be writing a tutorial series on medium on how to build a RESTful Laravel API that performs basic CRUD operations for a simple blogging app called Marblog.

The functionality is pretty simple: allow users to create, list, update and delete blog posts.

We’ll be taking a very simplistic approach to developing this application by just focusing on how to create, read, update and delete a blog post. Maybe in a later series, we can focus on using best practices for development and building it for production.

This series is really for ‘advanced-beginner’ level developers so we won’t be going through concepts like API Resources, User Authentication, Policies and the like. So, if this sounds good to you, stick around.

This series will require that you have some basic knowledge of Laravel. At least a basic understanding of basic Model-View-Controller principles, Eloquent ORM, Models and Routing. We won’t be getting too complicated, because we just want to implement the core functionality of the app.
